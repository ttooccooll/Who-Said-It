    <h1>Who Said It Quiz</h1>
    <div id="yep">
        <p>Tulsi Gabbard is now a member of the Republican party, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzQPGqggtBY" target="_blank">proudly speaking at Trump rallies</a>. Dick Cheney has endorsed Kamala Harris for president. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNVoSdUHw5I" target="_blank">Harris says that she is "honored."</a> Republicans in 2024 harp on concerns of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNReGVV9Mc8" target="_blank">"open border"</a> while Democrats make calls to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYuQekIL_CI" target="_blank">"back our allies."</a> I've never really liked either of these parties, but I do find it odd how many partisans I personally know that have stuck with their party over the past ten years despite the parties switching positions on most important issues.</p>
        <p>It begs the question, are you actually a <a href="https://www.americaexplained.org/who-are-the-southern-democrats.htm" target="_blank">"Southern Democrat?"</a> I'm referring to the group of individuals who lived in the South at the beginning of the 20th century, and for years did not realize that they were no longer in the party that represented the policies they endorsed. I've made this quiz to see if you can correctly determine what 2024's politicians actually stand for. Hopefully, it will be enlightening, no matter what concerns are near and dear to your heart.</p>
        <p>Your results may disturb you. I have now tested this with people of radically different political persuasions, who were very surprised by their results. Please know that I am not documenting your results. They are not saved outside of your browser and are yours for reflection.</p>
        <p>There will be nine quotes total for you to attribute. Let's begin. Who said:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="nope" style="display: none;">
        <h2>Surprise!</h2>
        <p>These are actually all quotes by other famous leaders or thinkers. Each of the quotes are linchpin ideas in their respective ideologies. I hope that you have placed the portraits of the leaders that you respect over the scenes that you want to see in this world. If you didn't, maybe do some research before the 5th of November...</p>
